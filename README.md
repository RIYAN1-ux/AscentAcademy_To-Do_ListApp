# AscentAcademy_To-Do_ListApp
I've built a To-Do List website which allows the user to create several to-do lists for daily tasks and easily add or remove items from the list. It has an input field used to add new tasks.
A transparent blurred box effect has been used to make the website attractive!
Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
